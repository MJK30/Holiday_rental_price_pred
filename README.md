# Holiday_rental_price_pred

The objective of the analysis is to predict the holiday rental prices for a medium-sized cultural city destination. The analysis is divided into:

1. Understanding the dataset
•	Understanding the Data Dictionary and dataset information
•	Understanding the features and labels of the dataset.

3. Data Preprocessing
•	Checking for null values- Check for Missing Completely at Random (MCAR), Missing at Random   
    (MAR) or Missing not at Random (MNAR) values. Imputation techniques like KNN, avg values,     
    Median values considered.
   

4. Data Visualization
•	Data Visualization is segregated for Numerical and Categorical Features.
•	The goal of data visualization is to get a basic understanding of data distribution, check for outliers and analyze the variations and correlation of features 
•	against the label. Gather Insights from the data
•	Consider possibilities where the feature values can justify the potential outliers. This 
will make the model handle more variance in the data.

5. Outlier Removal- Understand the distribution of the label (output).
•	Check for normal distribution(Z score method) or skewed distribution (Inter Quartile   method)
•	Use the insights gathered from Data Visualization for Outlier Removal.
  
6. Feature Selection
•	Backward stepwise Feature Selection
•	Forward stepwise Feature Selection
       
7. Modeling
•	Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Ridge Regression methods were used.
•	The analysis was carried out for all features, from backward stepwise selection and forward stepwise selection.
•	Evaluation parameters like MSE and R2 considered for each model
•	Results compared and plotted

Future Scope- 
-Create a front end(HTML,CSS,Javascript) and backend file for Web Application
-Host the server from AWS and deploy it into production where it can be used for all
